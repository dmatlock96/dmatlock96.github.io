                <h1>World Percent of Employment</h1>
                This scene shows the trend of the percent of worldwide total employment from 2005 to 2020.<br/>
                This plot demonstrates the percentage of worldwide workers has been increasing, which means that the developing countries are increasing in overall employment and self-employment has been going down globally for the last 15 years.<br/><br/>
                <i>This data is from the World Bank Indicators (WDI). I obtained this data using their APIs, not using pre-loaded CSV file.</i><br/>

                This scene shows the trend of the percent of total employment from 2005 to 2020 in the United States of America.<br/>
                The percentage of the workers in the US is significantly higher than the world average.<br/><br/>
                The total %, male %, and female % are over 90%. Let's see how the US compares against developing countries.

                This scene shows the trend of the percent of total employment from 2005 to 2020 in the China.<br/>
                The rate has been steadily rising over the past 15 years but appears to have decellerated in 2019.<br/><br/>
                Based on what WDI indicator says, we can see that China still has a lot to improve in this category although we should break it down further to know what specific subcategory that China has the most to in self-employment. Overall, we see China as a developing country has a lower employment rate, but is growing faster and currently hovers around the world average.

                This scene shows the trend of the percent of total employment from 2005 to 2020 in the China. We see that India, another developing country, is also growing very fast but is below the world average of employment percentage.<br/>
                India's situation is more like China, in that its employment growth rate is increasing faster and it is not nearly as high as the United States.<br/><br/>
                Both China and Inida are developing countries, and this is most likely the reason for their large growth rate.

    <blockquote>
            The indicator of status in employment distinguishes between two categories of the total employed. These are: (a) wage and salaried workers (also known as employees); and (b) self-employed workers. Self-employed group is broken down in the subcategories: self-employed workers with employees (employers), self-employed workers without employees (own-account workers), members of producers' cooperatives and contributing family workers (also known as unpaid family workers). Vulnerable employment refers to the sum of contributing family workers and own-account workers. The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.
